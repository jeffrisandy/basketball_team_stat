# Basketball Team Stats Tool
Python Web Development TechDegree **Project 2 - Basketball Team Stats Tool**

## Description

In this project you will be writing a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`. This data will need to be translated into a new data structure to store and organize a team of Basketball players into distributed teams. This tool will not only balance the teams by the total number of players but also let you generate some statistics for a given team.
